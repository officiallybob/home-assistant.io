The `samsungtv` platform allows you to control a [Samsung Smart TV](http://www.samsung.com/uk/consumer/tv-audio-video/televisions/).

When the TV is first connected, you will need to accept Home Assistant on the TV to allow communication.

To add a TV to your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
media_player:
  platform: samsungtv
  host: 192.168.0.10
  name: Living Room TV
```

Configuration variables:

- **host** *Required*: The IP of the Samsung Smart TV, e.g. 192.168.0.10
- **name** *Optional*: The name you would like to give to the Samsung Smart TV.


Currently known supported models:

- ES5500
- C7700
- UN55D6900 (Can not power on, but can control volume and power off)

If your model is not on the list then give it a test, if everything works correctly then add it to the list on [GitHub](https://github.com/balloob/home-assistant.io).
The two letters at the beginning of the model number represent the region, UE is Europe, UN is North America and UA is Asia & Australia. The two numbers following that represent the screen size. If you add your model remember to remove these before adding them to the list.
